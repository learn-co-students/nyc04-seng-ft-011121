# React Redux

- pure function: fn that doesn't manipulate data, and always gives the same results with the same input
- dispatch: change state, we must dispatch an action to the store
- action: what we're trying to do: `{ type: "whatWeWantToDo", payload: data }`
- reducer: function that calculates the new state based on the old state + an action
- store: where our state lives
- createSlice: gives us an easier way to organize our Redux code

## Redux (Part 1)

- [x] Create a `store` and set up initial state
- [x] Create a `reducer` function to return new states based on an `action`
- [x] Use `dispatch` to send an `action` to the `store` to make changes to state

## React Redux (Part 2)

- [ ] Setup reducer(s) and store
- [ ] Connect React to Redux with `<Provider>`
- [ ] Give components access to Redux state with `useSelector`
- [ ] Let components update the Redux store with `useDispatch`

## Rules for working with Redux

- Keep nested state to a minimum. Try to keep your state only one level deep per reducer.
- Don't duplicate state - use only the minimum amount of state necessary. Use `useSelector` to format your state nicely for your components.
- If you're using Redux Toolkit for reducers, you _can_ mutate state. If you're just using vanilla Redux, make sure your reducers _never_ mutate state. Use the spread operator to return a copy of state instead.

## Libraries

### Redux

- `store`: Single Source of Truth (where state lives)
  - `getState()`: read the current state from the store
  - `subscribe(listener)`: called when we want to listen for updates to state
- `dispatch({ type: "addItem" })`: called when we need to update state
- reducer: a pure function that takes state + an action and returns a new state
- action: an object describing how we want to change state ({ type: "addItem", payload: newItem })

### Redux Toolkit

- `createSlice`: a helpful function for creating a reducer, initializing state,
  and creating actions
- `configureStore`: a helpful function for setting up the store with one or more
  reducers

### React-Redux

- `Provider`: a component that takes the store as a prop, and allows child
  components to access the store
- `useSelector`: a custom hook that takes a selector function, and returns
  whatever state we want from the store (read)
- `useDispatch`: a custom hook that returns the dispatch function, which we can
  call to dispatch actions

## Setup

### Installation

We'll need to install two libraries:

```sh
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
```

The code for the Redux core library comes with Redux Toolkit.

React Redux will give us a component and a couple of hooks that we can use to
connect our components to the Redux store.

### Creating a Slice

Use the [`createSlice` function][create slice] to generate a slice with initial state and
reducer functions:

```js
// src/redux/userSlice.js
import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

const userSlice = {
  name: "user",
  initialState: {
    wallet: 100,
  },
  reducers: {
    addMoney: (state, action) => {
      state.wallet += action.payload;
    },
  },
};

// Export the reducer function, along with any actions from the slice:
export const { addMoney } = userSlice.actions;
export default userSlice.reducer;
```

### Setting up the Store

Use the [`configureStore` function][configure store] to create your store, and pass in any reducers
you're using:

```js
// src/redux/store.js
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import sushiReducer from "./sushiSlice.js";
import userReducer from "./userSlice.js";

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    user: userReducer,
    sushi: sushiReducer,
  },
});

export default store;
```

> NOTE: when you create your store with multiple reducers, your state in those
> reducers will be nested. So for example, to access the user's wallet from the
> userReducer, you'd use `state.user.wallet` instead of just `state.wallet`.

Use the [`<Provider>` component][provider] to connect your app to the store:

```js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import App from "./components/App";
import store from "./redux/store";

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

## Accessing State in Components

Import the [`useSelector` hook][use selector] in any component you need to
access the store from:

```js
import { useSelector } from "react-redux";
```

Call the `useSelector` hook in your component with a selector function to access
whatever data you need from the store:

```js
function Table() {
  const wallet = useSelector((state) => state.user.wallet);

  // rest of component
}
```

## Dispatching Actions

Import the [`useDispatch` hook][use dispatch] in any component you need to
dispatch an action from, along with the action creator from your slice file.

Call the `useDispatch` hook to get access to the dispatch function.

```js
import { useDispatch } from "react-redux";
import { addMoney } from "../slices/userSlice";

function Wallet() {
  // get access to the dispatch function
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    // dispatch an action
    dispatch(addMoney(10));
  }

  // rest of component
}
```

## Dispatching Actions from Fetch

The simplest way to dispatch an action from fetch is to create a reducer function first:

```js
import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

const sushiSlice = createSlice({
  name: "sushis",
  initialState: {
    entities: [],
  },
  reducers: {
    sushisAdded: (state, action) => {
      state.entities = action.payload;
    },
  },
});

export const { sushisAdded } = sushiSlice.actions;
export default sushiSlice.reducer;
```

Then dispatch an action when you have received a response from the fetch request:

```js
function App() {
  const sushis = useSelector((state) => state.sushi.entities);
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  useEffect(() => {
    // fetch like normal...
    fetch(API_URL)
      .then((r) => r.json())
      .then((sushiFromServer) => {
        // instead of setting state, dispatch an action with the data from the response
        dispatch(sushisAdded(sushiFromServer));
      });
  }, []);
}
```

That's all there is to it! If you want to handle more complex logic, like
loading state and error state, read on...

## Advanced Async Action Handling

It's a common pattern to handle the three stages of a fetch request in your
reducer separately:

- "pending": we sent a request and are waiting for a response
- "fulfilled": we got a response successfully!
- "rejected": the response threw an error

To support this pattern, Redux Toolkit gives us a special [`createAsyncThunk`
function][async thunk] (isn't programming wild y'all) that will return three
actions when given async code.

First, import it:

```js
// src/redux/sushiSlice.js
import { createSlice, createAsyncThunk } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
```

Then, write your async action:

```js
// createAsyncThunk takes:
// - a string (label) as a first argument
// - a callback function that returns a Promise as a second argument
export const fetchSushi = createAsyncThunk("sushis/fetchSushi", () => {
  // must return a Promise!! make sure to return!
  return fetch("http://localhost:3001/sushis")
    .then((r) => r.json())
    .then((sushiArray) => {
      const updatedSushi = sushiArray.map((sushi) => ({
        ...sushi,
        eaten: false,
      }));
      // whatever data is returned from the Promise will be used as the payload for the action
      return updatedSushi;
    });
});
```

To handle this action with your reducer, we have to use can use this
[builder syntax](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createSlice#the-extrareducers-builder-callback-notation)
in the `extraReducers` section:

```js
const sushiSlice = createSlice({
  name: "sushis",
  // initial state now has the sushi data along with error and status states
  initialState: {
    error: null,
    status: "idle",
    entities: [],
    startIndex: 0,
  },
  reducers: {
    sushisAdded: (state, action) => {
      state.entities = action.payload;
    },
    nextSushi: (state) => {
      state.startIndex = (state.startIndex + 4) % state.entities.length;
    },
  },
  extraReducers: (builder) => {
    builder
      .addCase(fetchSushi.pending, (state) => {
        state.status = "pending";
      })
      .addCase(fetchSushi.fulfilled, (state, action) => {
        state.status = "fulfilled";
        state.entities = action.payload;
        state.error = null;
      })
      .addCase(fetchSushi.rejected, (state, action) => {
        state.status = "rejected";
        state.error = action.payload;
      });
  },
});
```

Now we can use the exported `fetchSushi` function when we want to initiate the
request, and all our state updates happen under the hood based on the status of
our fetch request!

```js
function App() {
  const sushis = useSelector((state) => state.sushi.entities);
  const isLoaded = useSelector((state) => state.sushi.status === "fulfilled");
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  useEffect(() => {
    // now, fetch happens in the action creator
    dispatch(fetchSushi());
  }, []);
}
```

## Handling Actions in Multiple Reducers

Typically, each action will only need to be handled in one reducer; however,
sometimes you have one action affects multiple pieces of state in separate
reducers.

For example, if I have state like this:

```js
{
  // state held in userSlice reducer
  user: {
    wallet: 100
  },
  // state held in sushiSlice reducer
  sushi: {
    entities: [{ id: 1, name: "Ahi", eaten: false, price: 10}]
  }
}
```

And I want to have an action where when a sushi is eaten, that sushi is updated
in the `sushiSlice`, but the user's wallet is also updated in the `userSlice`, I
could dispatch multiple actions:

```js
function handleEatSushi() {
  if (wallet >= sushi.price) {
    dispatch(sushiEaten(sushi));
    dispatch(takeMoney(sushi.price));
  }
}
```

But ideally, I'd just have one action to dispatch that would be handled in both
places. To accomplish this, we can once again use the `extraReducers` option
in our reducer, and handle the `sushiEaten` action in the `userSlice`.

```js
import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import { sushiEaten } from "./sushiSlice";

const userSlice = createSlice({
  name: "user",
  initialState: {
    wallet: 100,
  },
  reducers: {
    // could dispatch multiple actions...
    // takeMoney(state, action) {
    //   state.wallet -= action.payload;
    // },
    addMoney(state, action) {
      state.wallet += action.payload;
    },
  },
  extraReducers: (builder) => {
    // but we could also handle the same action in multiple reducers
    builder.addCase(sushiEaten, (state, action) => {
      state.wallet -= action.payload.price;
    });
  },
});
```

Then, we'd only need to dispatch one action:

```js
function handleEatSushi() {
  if (wallet >= sushi.price) {
    dispatch(sushiEaten(sushi));
  }
}
```
